# GIS Arcade Script for Determining Most Common Obstacle Proximity Category

## Overview
This Arcade script is designed to analyze spatial data from a FeatureSet and determine the most common proximity category of obstacles around a given segment path. The script performs buffer analysis at various distances and identifies which category (Company, Battalion, Brigade, or Division) is most frequently encountered.

## Functions and Logic

### `mostCommonValue(arr)`
This function takes an array as input and returns the most common value in the array.

- **Parameters:**
  - `arr`: Array of values to analyze.
- **Logic:**
  1. Create an empty dictionary `countDict` to store the count of each value.
  2. Iterate through the array, incrementing the count for each value in the dictionary.
  3. Determine the value with the highest count and return it.

### Main Script Logic

1. **FeatureSet Retrieval:**
   - Retrieve the `obstacle` FeatureSet from the datastore, focusing on the `gridcode` attribute.
   - Filter the `obstacle` FeatureSet to exclude features with `gridcode` equal to 1 (`obstacleR`).

2. **Segment Path Extraction:**
   - Extract the geometry of the current feature (`$feature`) and get its first path segment.

3. **Buffer Analysis:**
   - Define a dictionary `corridor` to map categories to specific codes.
   - Initialize an empty array `arr` to store proximity categories.
   - For each vertex in the segment path:
     - Create buffers at distances of 500, 1500, 3000, and 6000 meters.
     - Check for intersections between the buffer and the filtered obstacles (`obstacleR`).
     - If an intersection is found, add the corresponding category (`Company`, `Battalion`, `Brigade`, or `Division`) to the array and break out of the loop for the current vertex.

4. **Determine Most Common Category:**
   - Use the `mostCommonValue` function to find the most common category in the array `arr`.
   - Map the most common category to its corresponding code using the `corridor` dictionary.

5. **Return Result:**
   - Return the code for the most common category, or `-1` if no common category is found (`unknown`).

## Usage
This script is intended to be used within the context of an ArcGIS application where the `$datastore` and `$feature` variables are predefined. The script can be adapted to various use cases where proximity analysis and category determination are required.

## Example
Here is an example of how the script might be used within an ArcGIS environment to determine the most common obstacle proximity category for a given segment path:

```arcade
var obstacle = FeatureSetByName($datastore, "obstacle", ['gridcode'], TRUE)
var obstacleR = Filter(obstacle, 'gridcode <> 1')

var segment = Geometry($feature)["paths"][0]
var corridor = {'Company': 148, 'Battalion': 149, 'Brigade': 150, 'Division': 151, 'unknown': -1}
var arr = []

for (var vertice in segment) {
    var segVertice = segment[vertice]
    var bufferWidths = [500, 1500, 3000, 6000]

    for (var width in bufferWidths) {
        var buffF = Buffer(segVertice, bufferWidths[width], 'meters')
        var result = Intersects(buffF, obstacleR)

        if (Count(result) != 0) {
            if (bufferWidths[width] == 500) {
                Push(arr, 'Company')
                break
            }
            if (bufferWidths[width] == 1500) {
                Push(arr, 'Battalion')
                break
            }
            if (bufferWidths[width] == 3000) {
                Push(arr, 'Brigade')
                break
            }
            if (bufferWidths[width] == 6000) {
                Push(arr, 'Division')
                break
            }
        }
    }
}

var mostCommon = mostCommonValue(arr)
var key = IIF(IsEmpty(mostCommon), 'unknown', mostCommon)
return corridor[key]
```

## Conclusion
This Arcade script is a powerful tool for performing spatial analysis on GIS data, particularly for determining the proximity category of obstacles around a path segment. By utilizing buffer analysis and custom functions, the script efficiently identifies and returns the most common category, facilitating better decision-making in spatial data applications.
